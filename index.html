                of
                rice, cooking oil, and vegetables such as tomato, onion, red pepper, garlic, ginger and Scotch bonnet
                chili
                peppers. To enhance the colour of the dish, tomato paste (pur√©e) is added. As seasoning, spices, salt,
                stock
                cubes (a blend of flavour enhancers, salt, nutmeg and herbs), curry powder and dried thyme are used. To
                complement the dish, chicken, turkey, beef or fish are often served with the dish</p>

        <h3>Method of preparation</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Blend your tomatoes, red pepper, scotch bonnet peppers in a food processor or blender for about 45
                seconds, make sure that everything is blended well.</li>
            <li>In a medium sized pot, heat your oil on medium-high heat. Once the oil is heated add the onions you set
                aside and fry just until they turn golden brown. Once the onions, have turned brown in color add the
                tomato paste and fry for 2-3 minutes. Then add the blended tomato mixture (reserve about 1/4 cup and set
                aside) and fry the mixture with the onions and tomato paste for about 30 minutes. Make sure you stir
                consistently so that the tomato mixture does not burn.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, turn the heat down to medium, and add the chicken stock. Mix and add your seasonings
                (salt, curry powder, thyme, all purpose seasoning, and the Knorr stock cube). Continue to boil for 10
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the parboiled rice to the pot. Mix it very well with the tomato stew. At this point if you need to
                add water so that the rice is level with the tomato mixture/chicken stock go ahead and do so. Add the
                bay leaves, cover the pot, and cook on medium to low heat for 15-30 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the liquid has almost dried up add the remaining tomato stew, cover, and let it cook for another
                5-10 minutes heat until the liquid has completely dried up. Turn off the heat, mix thoroughly, and your
                Jollof Rice is ready to be eaten!
